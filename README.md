This program analyzes letter frequencies in text documents and then generate new documents based on those frequencies. The new documents are generated by "level k analysis", which determines the probability with which each character follows every possible sequence of characters of length k, using pre-existing text documents. The higher the level of analysis, the more accurate the new generated text will be.
